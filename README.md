# Health Records

## Health Care Smart Contract

Main idea is to provide a clean and easy way for patients to see their personal medical records.

The information will be stored on a digital ledger, this means if a patient was moving from one hospital to another, they would be able to do so with ease and without having to fill out numerous forms. 

Records can then also be viewed by the patientâ€™s preferred physician on the blockchain network.

Each patient is able to determine who is able to see his medical records.

The medical record's ownership moves back to the patient, and he is the one who decide which doctor or medical institution have access to it.

Since store data into the blockchain is expensive, it will only store a IPFS CID (https://docs.filebase.com/ipfs/ipfs-cids), which will be a json document with the patient's medical registry.
